Early in April, the week-end of 30th March and 1st April to be exact, eXo moves its projects from the centralized SCM [Subversion](https://svn.exoplatform.org) to the Distributed SCM [Git](http://git-scm.com/). Our Git repositories will be hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/exoplatform/).

This move/conversion will be processed during the week-end and all projects will be updated the week after (Maven settings, repositories clean-up, â€¦).

Starting on mid-March some migration tests will be processed. **Don't clone any repository on GitHub before April** to contribute to eXo. These repositories will be recreated in the real migration process and you won't be able to merge back (easily) any change done in these repositories.
